== The Graph of Hamilton
:imagesdir: img

I love Hamilton the Musical, I was lucky and able to see it from the last free seat at the SFO performance in 2019.

Like https://twitter.com/sxywu[Shirley Wu^] I've been listening to it on repeat since forever, we even got Disney+ and a projector canvas to watch it when it came out.

For a long time I've been wanting to turn Shirley Wu's amazing https://pudding.cool/2017/03/hamilton/["An Interactive Visualization of Every Line in Hamilton"^] into a Neo4j graph for myself and others to play around with.

Please check out her work and play with it, it's really inspiring.

== Data Source

Thankfully she made the data available as part of her https://github.com/sxywu/hamilton/[GitHub Repository^] for the visualization.

The JSON files can be found here, together with some explanations.

https://github.com/sxywu/hamilton/tree/master/src/data

Each JSON file has keys which are usually id's for the entities pointing to a list of values, some of which can also be nested.

Here is the final data model I ended up with for the data:

image::hamilton-model.png[]

We have

* `Singer` that can be `Individual` or `Group`
* `Song`, with
* `Lines`, that a Singer `SINGS`, are `DIRECTED` at a Singer or `EXCLUDE` a Singer
* `CONTAINS` Word
* `HAS` a `Theme`, which
* is `PART_OF` a `Category`

== Singers

Let's load the data one by one, starting with the Singers.

.char_list.json
[source,javascript]
----
{"1": ["Aaron Burr", "M", "individual", true, "rgb(149,65,200)"]}
----

We load the data, and process each key and it's value as a row to create a Singer with an additinal label.

[source,cypher]
----
call apoc.load.json('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sxywu/hamilton/master/src/data/char_list.json') YIELD value
UNWIND keys(value) AS key
WITH key, value[key] AS data

call apoc.create.node(["Singer",apoc.text.capitalize(data[2])], {id:key, name:data[0], gender:data[1],xx:data[3],color:data[4]}) yield node 
return node;
----

== Songs

Songs are straightforward with just an id and title.

.song_list.json
[source,javascript]
----
{"1": ["Alexander Hamilton", "#9541c8"]}
----

We load the data again and turn them into nodes.

[source,cypher]
----
call apoc.load.json('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sxywu/hamilton/master/src/data/song_list.json') YIELD value
UNWIND keys(value) AS key
WITH key, value[key] AS data

MERGE (s:Song {id:key}) 
ON CREATE SET s.title = data[0], s.color = data[1]
RETURN s;
----

== Lines

Lines is a bit more complicated, here is the https://github.com/sxywu/hamilton/tree/master/src/data#linesjson[description^] from Shirley's repository

====
----
key: line key
(example) 1:31 would be song 1, line 31
(example) 1:1-5 would be song 1, lines 1 through 5
value: array of 4 values
0: line key
1: array
0: character(s) singing
1: character(s) excluded from singing
2: character(s) the lines were directed to
2: array of the actual lyrics in those lines
3: number of lines
----
====

.lines.json
[source,javascript]
----
{"1:1-5":["1:1-5",[["1"],[""],[""]],["How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a","Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a","Forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence","Impoverished, in squalor","Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?"],5]}
----

Here after loading the data, we 

. split the id into song-id and lines
. find the song
. create an `Lines` node for each key
. connect sines to the song
. then for each type of relationship to a singer (SING, EXCLUDED, DIRECTED)
. we loop over the id-array and connect the lines to that singer appropriately
. for the SING relationship we also connect the singer to the actual song

[source,cypher]
----
call apoc.load.json('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sxywu/hamilton/master/src/data/lines.json') YIELD value
UNWIND keys(value) AS key
WITH key, value[key] AS data

WITH key, split(key,':')[0] as song, split(key,':')[1] as lines, data[1][0] as singers, data[1][1] as excluded, data[1][2] as directed, data[2] as text, data[3] as count

MATCH (s:Song {id:song})
MERGE (l:Lines {id:key}) 
ON CREATE SET l.text = text, l.count = count, l.lines = lines
MERGE (l)-[:OF_SONG]->(s)

FOREACH (id IN [id IN singers WHERE id <> ""] |
    MERGE (p:Singer {id:id})
    MERGE (p)-[:SINGS]->(l)
    MERGE (p)-[:PERFORMS]->(s)
)
FOREACH (id IN [id IN excluded WHERE id <> ""] |
    MERGE (p:Singer {id:id})
    MERGE (p)-[:EXCLUDED]->(l)
)
FOREACH (id IN [id IN directed WHERE id <> ""] |
    MERGE (p:Singer {id:id})
    MERGE (l)-[:DIRECTED]->(p)
)
RETURN count(*);
----

Now we can have our first graph query, that shows us who sings which songs.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Singer)-[r:SINGS]->()-[:OF_SONG]->(s:Song) 
RETURN s.id, s.title, collect(distinct p.name) 
ORDER by toInteger(s.id) asc
LIMIT 25;
----

There is also a file `character.json` which contains the same singing information as the lines, so we don't need to process it.

////
// test "character.json" if it adds anything (nope)
// ["characters", "conversing", "excluding"]

call apoc.load.json('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sxywu/hamilton/master/src/data/characters.json') yield value
with value.characters as value
unwind keys(value) as key
with key, value[key] as data
MATCH (p:Singer {id:key})
UNWIND data as id
WITH * where id <> ""
MATCH (l:Lines {id:id})
MERGE (p)-[:SINGS]->(l);
////

== Words

Something that's not used in the visualization but I wanted to include in the graph are the words of the text.

We could have extracted them ourselves but stemming etc. was already taken care of in `words.json`.

Here we have the word as key and the line within the lines as array of values.

.words.json
[source,javascript]
----
{"how":["1:1/1:1-5","3:49/3:47-51"]}
----

When loading the file, the most annoying part is splitting the string to find the lines-key and the data to compute the offset in the text-array.

[source,cypher]
----
call apoc.load.json('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sxywu/hamilton/master/src/data/words.json') YIELD value
UNWIND keys(value) AS key
WITH key, value[key] AS data

MERGE (w:Word {word:key})
WITH *
UNWIND data as entries
WITH w, split(entries, "/") as parts
WITH w, parts[1] as lines, parts[0] as line
WITH *, toInteger(split(line,':')[1])-toInteger(split(split(lines,':')[1],'-')[0]) as idx
MATCH (l:Lines {id:lines})
MERGE (w)<-[:CONTAINS {pos:line, idx:idx}]-(l);
----

Now we can query for Words within lines of songs

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (s:Song)<-[:OF_SONG]-(l:Lines)-[c:CONTAINS]->(n:Word) where n.word = 'satisfied' 
RETURN s.title, l.text[c.idx],n.word LIMIT 25
----

== Themes

The theme list has the theme id as key and some text examples and the category name as values
Not sure what the "true" value means, it's true in all entiries.

.theme_list.json
[source,javascript]
----
{"1": [["Just you wait", "wait for it"], "Ambition", true]}
----

We create the theme by id and set the text and category, but then also create a category node that we want to connect to.

[source,cypher]
----
call apoc.load.json('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sxywu/hamilton/master/src/data/theme_list.json') YIELD value
UNWIND keys(value) AS key
WITH key, value[key] AS data

MERGE (t:Theme {id:key})
ON CREATE SET t.category=data[1], t.text=data[0]

MERGE (c:Category {name:data[1]})
MERGE (t)-[:PART_OF]->(c)

RETURN *;
----

The actual themes are more complicated.
With the theme id as key, we have a triple nested list of lines and lines-ids and the text lines.

.themes.json
[source,javascript]
----
{"1":[ [["1:27/24-27"],["But just you wait, just you wait..."]],[["1:54/54"],["Just you wait!"]]]}
----

But we're only interested in the lines keys and the offset, so we do our usual spiel of splitting hairs to compute the index.
This time they lines-key is not directly there so we need to construct it from song and lines-range.

[source,cypher]
----
call apoc.load.json('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sxywu/hamilton/master/src/data/themes.json') YIELD value
UNWIND keys(value) AS key
WITH key, value[key] AS data

MATCH (t:Theme {id:key})

UNWIND data as phrases
UNWIND phrases[0] as entries
WITH t, split(entries, ":") as parts
WITH t, parts[0] as song, split(parts[1],"/") as lines

MATCH (l:Lines {id:song + ":" + lines[1]})

WITH l, t, toInteger(lines[0]) - toInteger(split(lines[1],"-")[0]) as idx

MERGE (l)-[:HAS {idx:idx}]->(t)
RETURN *;
----

Now we can see who sings about "Death" in Hamilton.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH p1=(c:Category {name:"Death"})<-[:PART_OF]-(t:Theme)<-[h:HAS]-(l:Lines)-[:OF_SONG]->(s:Song), p2=(l)<-[:SINGS]-(p:Singer)
RETURN p1,p2
----

== Exploration - Themes directed at Hamilton

Now we can start exploring this wonderful dataset.

E.g. to see who's most often directing lines at Hamilton, unsurprisingly it's Eliza followed by Burr.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Singer)-[:SINGS]->(l:Lines)-[:DIRECTED]->(:Singer {name:"Alexander Hamilton"}),(l)-[:HAS]->(t)-[:PART_OF]->(c)
RETURN p.name, count(*) as freq, collect(distinct c.name) as categories
ORDER BY freq DESC
----
